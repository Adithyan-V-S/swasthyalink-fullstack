## Risk Assessment Algorithm

### Health Score Calculation
The system calculates an overall health score (0-100) based on:

1. **Age Factor** (15% weight)
   - Optimal age range: 25-45
   - Penalty for ages outside optimal range

2. **BMI Factor** (20% weight)
   - Optimal BMI: 18.5-24.9
   - Underweight (<18.5): 30 points
   - Normal (18.5-24.9): 50 points
   - Overweight (25-29.9): 70 points
   - Obese (‚â•30): 90 points

3. **Blood Pressure Factor** (25% weight)
   - Normal (<120/80): 20 points
   - Elevated (120-129/<80): 40 points
   - Stage 1 (130-139/80-89): 60 points
   - Stage 2 (‚â•140/‚â•90): 80 points
   - Crisis (‚â•180/‚â•120): 100 points

4. **Lifestyle Factors** (30% weight)
   - Smoking: Never (10), Former (30), Current (80)
   - Exercise: Regular (20), Occasional (50), Sedentary (80)

5. **Lab Values** (10% weight)
   - Cholesterol: <200 (20), 200-239 (50), ‚â•240 (80)
   - Glucose: <100 (20), 100-125 (50), ‚â•126 (80)

### Risk Categories
- **Excellent** (0-30): Outstanding health indicators
- **Good** (31-50): Generally healthy with minor concerns
- **Fair** (51-70): Some health factors need attention
- **Poor** (71-100): Multiple health concerns present
